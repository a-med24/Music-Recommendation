# Music-Recommendation

The following app was created for my AP Computer Science Principles course, in which students had to develop an app of their own volition that included a UI, parameters, and an algorithm consisting of sequencing, conditionals, and iterations. 

I utilized JavaScript on Code.org as well as App Lab for the UI. It allows users to select a music genre and preferred song duration. After making their selection, users can navigate to the next screen, where the app displays the song name, artist, and album cover. A dedicated button on said screen provides additional song options for further exploration. 

Features:

- Genre Selection
- Duration Filter
- Song Display
- Next Song Options
- Dynamic Genre Image
