# Music-Recommendation

The following app was created for my AP Computer Science Principles course, in which students had to develop an app of their own volition that included a UI, parameters, and an algorithm consisting of sequencing, conditionals, and iterations. 

I utilized JavaScript on Code.org as well as App Lab for the UI. It allows users to select a music genre and preferred song duration. After making their selection, users can navigate to the next screen, where the app displays the song name, artist, and album cover. A dedicated button on said screen provides additional song options for further exploration. 

Features:

- Genre Selection
- Duration Filter
- Song Display
- Next Song Options
- Dynamic Genre Image

How It Works:

- Choose the Genre dropdown to pick a genre
- Genre image updates at the bottom of the screen to match selection
  
- Choose the Duration Dropdown to pick between the options: Short (< 2 Minutes), Medium (2-4 minutes), Long (4+ minutes)
- Press the "Get Your Songs" button to go to the results screen
  
- The app filters the songs and shows a random song of the filtered options
- The result shows the Song Name, Artist, and Album Cover Image
- A button to showcase the next song can be used to display another matching song from the filtered list
- If there are no other matches, the app shows: "No other songs"
- Press back to return to the Home Screen to change filters


- The dataset utilized was one I created with my own research. The data table has about ~75+ songs
